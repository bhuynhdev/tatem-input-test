# Tatem Technical Assesment

### This is Bao Huynh's solution of Tatem's technical take-home assignment.

The app is hosted on [https://tatem-input-baohuynh.netlify.app/](https://tatem-input-baohuynh.netlify.app/)

```

Tasks:

* add keyboard navigation to the form so that you can navigate through the inputs via pressing the up and down arrow keys
* add a submit function that saves the form data to localStorage
* display submitted data
* persist submitted data (if data currently exists in localStorage, on a subsequent page load it should display that data)  


Optional Tasks (not necessary for completion):

* host this site on any free hosting platform
* style the interface as you'd like

```
